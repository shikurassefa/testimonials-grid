## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
to be honest i build confidence beyond some concepts like when i use grid 
```CSS
.testimonials
{
display :grid;
grid-template-columns:repeat(auto-fit,minmax(260px,auto))
}
```   
if childrens of testimonials span some columns or rows(which is in my code) we need `media query` to achieve responsiveness.

### Continued development
in addition to bulding projects like this that needs CSS i wana to focus on mastering React and build faster and scalable applications.

### Usefull Resources
i used Chat Gpt like for suggestions so and grid reference.
